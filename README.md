This is one of mine first app with Laravel framework. This is a simply to do list, when you register you will have private
tab to create, update, delete and mark as completed your tasks.
I used pagination, after fifth task it will be expand on the second page.
I deployed this app to heroku, http://angelitodolist.herokuapp.com/ so you can try it.
Thank you for reading.
